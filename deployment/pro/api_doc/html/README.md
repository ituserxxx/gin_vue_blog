### What is ShowDoc?

When we take over a module or project which has been developed by others, we always feel crazy watching at the codes without notes or comments.

Where is the document?! Where is the document?! **Show me the doc!!**

Programmers often want others to write technical documents, but not by themselves. Writing technical documents need lots of time and works, such as it needs to consider how to handle the format and layout of the documents. Beside, the man who writes the documents has to think all kinds of non-technical details. For example, which catalog should to be put in the newly-established word document.

In general, all kinds of the word documents are dispersively maintained by different people in a team.

How to get the latest documents? Here is a way.

The man gets the documents by shouting out, Lol. Then he will receive them from others through IMs or E-mail. This kind of communication is not so bad, but this is not the most effective way.
